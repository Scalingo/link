# Changelog

## To be released (v3)

This is the first v3 release of LinK. The main goal of the V3 release is to introduce a plugin systems for the actions taken by LinK when it gets or loose the control of an endpoint.
The previous behavior continue to live via the `arp` plugin. However other plugins can be developed to manage other types of endpoints.

This version is fully retro-compatibility and can be used at the same time than the v2 release.
However this retro-compatibility will be later dropped in the v3 branch.
There's also a retro-compatibility layer on the HTTP API. V2 clients should work with a V3 server.
